# To live is to fight and to fight is to live
#### Hadouken! Pleased to meet you.

My name is Ryu Hoshi (ãƒªãƒ¥ã‚¦ RyÅ«) and this here is my website.

After defeating Sagat and M. Bison for the nth time, 
Iâ€™ve decided to downshift my martial arts career a little bit and get into this IT thing â€• sensei tells me that thereâ€™s 
a lot of money on the Internet, and a whole lot less getting punched in the face. 
I created a little website to market my personal brand, then maybe i will sell a few t-shirts, nunchucks, that sort of thing â€• 
I think itâ€™ll be a big hit (TO THE SOLAR PLEXUS IYKWIM HAHAHA!.. woo, goddamn, I love hitting people...). 
Anyhow, here's what I wanted to create â€• for starters just a quick intro page to let me know what Iâ€™m all about.  
Thanks for reading, man , Iâ€™m off to the Shaolin temple for a few weeks (teambuilding excersice, such b*llshit, ugh). 
And remember, winners never lose! âœŒPeace!

Oops, forgot to talk about the technical part ðŸ˜…

So, I've decided to host it with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), because it's so much easier, cost efficient, 
and saves me time on deployments. Other than that it's just good old plain HTML and CSS with a very little bit of JavaScript. 
`<head>` is built using excellent [**HEAD**](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) for reference, `<body>` uses some of the styles from the great 
[**Semantic UI**](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) framework. Website is frequently tested with 
[**Lighthouse**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) automated tool. Amazing [**Workbox**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) 
helps build a decent Service Worker for this website _(hence it even works offline)_, [**serve**](https://zeit.co/blog/serve-7) 
is used to run my website locally during development. I have [**workbox**](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox) and 
[**serve**](https://github.com/zeit/serve) npm packages installed globally with `sudo npm install --global workbox-cli serve`, 
and I've also set up a pre-commit git hook which automatically runs `workbox generateSW workbox-config.js` before I commit and push my code to GitHub, 
so that I don't have to do it manually every time I make changes. **.git/hooks/pre-commit** looks as simple as this:

``` bash
#!C:\cygwin64\bin\bash.exe
if workbox generateSW workbox-config.js ; then
  git add sw.js
  git add sw.js.map
  exit 0
else
  echo "Cannot generate sw.js"
  echo "Aborting"
fi
```
